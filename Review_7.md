### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 5 stars and I give this game a 4 star rating.

## Summary

We first hear screams of people running round out on the streets while three people were waking up in an upside down car. The man inside gets out and helps get the woman out because she has a major cut around her stomach. The man that helped the woman was Deacon and the woman is Sarah. The third person in the car is Boozer and the three of them are trying to get to the top of a building where a rescue helicopter was waiting for some survivors. The three of them get there in time but there was only room for one more and they made their decision on letting Sarah go and then find where their station is to regroup there. 
   
A few months of apocalyptic went by and we have Deacon and Boozer bikers chasing someone who stole important rations. The chase became exciting dogging flaming bottles and trees while the enemy tried to escape. Deacon was able to shoot the enemies motorcycle making it unable to ride and then the enemy runs on foot but Deacon is an expert tracker. Decon follows the footsteps and the blood that was left behind by the enemy. Eventually Deacon was ambushed by thugs and he had to fight them all in order to move on.    


## Final Thoughts
It was different because the transportation was on a motorcycle and it was circal to make sure the bike had gas and fixed any damage it could have taken on the road. I always made sure my bike had the best essentials like amor, better tires, and longer lasting gas tanks to extend my trips from camps. Also, I like how many different types of zombies there are to keep the player in survival mode and think of ways to deal with them. The regular zombies werenâ€™t too much of a problem to handle and then there were little children like zombies who can move faster but are easy to knock down.
