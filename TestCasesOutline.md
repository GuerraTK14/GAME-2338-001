## Test Steps: 
| # | Description | Expected Result | Check (√) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A player can hit, run and climb for survival and the player must be able to go from on building to another without too much of a problem. |Trying to see if the control has good button functions and if some player would rather have a different style. |So far the grappling hook has a little glitch sometimes when you use it, I just restart the game because when I'm on a serious mission I need it to be ready.   |			
| 2 | Playing mission “Siblings” and the player must go inside a school building to find explosives. | Trying out both easy and hard modes to see if a player can still pass it with the same amount of materials. |The process of player hard had passed and the directions of the game were quite good. Players will have less materials to find compared to easy but it is possible for any player to proceed |			
| 3 |Having a mission that makes you stand your ground to get rid of alot of zombies in groups and then leads to coming at you all at once. |Trying to see how well the invisible fields around them don’t overlap and that any player can feel safe with numbers |Their arms do pass each other's bodies but their rib cage area does stay far apart. |	
| 4 |Gather as many zombies into one area in town by using gun or lund weapons to track them all around. |Try to see how well the system can do to load so many weapons being used without too much problems. |Used the fire bottle, gerade and rifle all at one group of zombies and the system was able to load a good time for recovery without bug problems being meant.|		
| 5 |Near the first safety camp in the south the first building when climbing up the player gets stuck in the middle of the building. | I try to see if it happens too often and that if there's a way to stop that from happening again or to get out. |So far there are two ways to get out: by killing the character or restart the game. |			
| 6 |Testing the map system in Old town where some buildings look like they're floating in mid air |Trying to see how to fix the areas quickly without too much of a problem and without restarting the game. |So far the places come back to normal by looking away and the program fixes it before the player goes around. |			
| 7 |In old town clearing all safe zones by turning on the power and killing any zombies that still hang around there. |Trying to see if all zombies come out of their hiding places and not get stuck in the holes or mid doorway. |So far I can still get rid of them but it's annoying when you hear them but don’t know where they could be. Also, when you're playing hard mode and you don’t want to take the risk of going outside with even more zombies to come. |			
| 8 |Having to see different zombies attacks power like Biters, Bombers, Demolisher and Night Hunters.|Trying to see the difference between attacks each zombie has in different modes is easy and hard to find out if a player can beat them with the same materials.|So far in hard mode the player would have a hard time to kill some zombies like demolisher and night hunter. Also, bombers in easy mode could take 25 points of health away while hard mode could take the whole health points away |			
| 9 |When going to clear a zombie hoard in one of the safe zones and having a bomber coming because of loud hitting sounds the player is making. The bomber comes for the  player while they get back for two dash jumps and the player throws any weapon at the bomer. Then it get ready to pop any the player gets a safe distance and the bomber explodes while the player instantly dies. |To find out why if all the time in hard mode when a player get a safe distance from the bomber the code acted right, Must try killing 6 bombers to find out what the problem is and does the system need a restart for the zombies to act right.
 |The bombers are acting in hard mode because they restarted the game and it was annoying because I was in the middle of getting a supply crate when I saw a bomber and it still killed me when I shot an arrow. So the bombers are now working right when I’m at a safe distance |			
| 10 |Climbing on buildings, poles or radio towers and sometimes they don’t connect with the character or make them touch anything but still be able to climb. Happen mostly to poles or going up the radio towers and why is the player not reacting to gravity.  |Try to climb three different locations of bridges, buildings or poles to see if this problem can be solved on its own or needs me restarted.  |The game has now acted right for its program and climb at the moments are good too. The character can climb at the right point of contact|

| 1 |Me (Justus) playing on PC i've listed as mentioned 10 bugs/issues that i've found from April 1st-May 1st |The tests conducted were by me and my Steam pals |Most bugs we've encountered were just silly and hardly game breaking with the exception of the solo duplication glitch? As only a few made me infuriated. There were also other bugs/issues that were encountered as well that i haven't listed above. |			
| 2 | I am Matthew Guerra playing the game on Playstation to see 8 test issues I have found from April 20 to May 8|The test was conducted by me Matthew |Having to see if the game could be entertaining for all players pro or noob? The game has many issues with accomplishing a quest and making sure that a new person to video games could pass the quest with no problems.|
