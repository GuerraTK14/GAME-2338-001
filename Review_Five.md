### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 5 stars and I give this game a 5 star rating. 

## Summary

We have a main character who needs to collect gold squares in order to complete the level and move on to a harder floor. The player can go up and down ladders. climb on pipes and fall straight down then doesn’t take a damage or lose life. Aslo the player has a heat ray gun to make the rocky looking floor evaporate and the player can fall down if they move towards it. Once the floor is no longer there it can reappear after a couple of seconds and if the player is in the hole then the player will die and have to start all over.

Also, the player must avoid some machines and they will follow the player even going up ladders and pipes. To stop them is to use the rocky looking floors and have the robots fall in them but there are some robots that could climb out of the holes n and things could get more difficult. There are some robots that can run faster but can’t climb out of the holes that the player has created. Also when the player takes too long to gather all the gold will trigger an alarm to bring in new robots that are stronger and smart to get the main player.

In Lode Runner the main title has three selections to choose of what the player wants to do in the game. The first one is playing the game and it's about having the player going up the difficulty floors and getting the player used to how the game is. Then we have a custom stage where the player creates their own level and plays other players' creation levels. The last selection is Classic and the player will start playing a more difficult level right at the beginning. 

## Final Thoughts

Lode Runner is an alright game to play like a pac man and dig pump because its just to achieve the level. I wouldn’t mind playing the game for a couple of months to unlock the characters it gives out when you finish a certain floor. Also, to feel the fear of losing time to finish the game or not to get caught by the robot by making quick thinking escapes.
