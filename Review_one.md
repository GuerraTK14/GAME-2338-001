## Summary

Sword art online Integral Factor is an RPG where you fight monsters with swords, clubs, axs etc. Then you come across two unfamiliar people, they say their names are koharu and kirito who helps you defeat some monsters. Once the battle was done they left the beta test to go in the real game and find each other again back. Then eventually both Koharu and Kirito were able to fine you but when it was once great turned into an awful nightmare. We talked down by someone named kayaba akihiko the creator of the game tells the players that you canâ€™t log out and when your health is depleted you die in the real world. That in order to escape the virtual world is to clear 100 floors.

Everyone was frightened until the main player and Koharu left to escape the terrifying crowds who were screaming, running and shocked. So when it was all clear the main player and his partner started to do as much info collecting they could do. Once they have all that they need to start handling themselves they defeated monsters and talked to people to help further their experience points.    

## Final Thoughts
I like the game because you're able to have so many weapons to change when you are fighting monsters or the boss battles. Aslo the skill abilities are amazing of the power that comes with it and the combo strikes that could deal. The armor can also be changed and increased to protect you from being harm by negative effects of paralyzing, fortsed, poison or burned. But it does become a pain when you want the best equipment is to defeat monsters items but you never know if you get it or not
