## Details

### Game Title

### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 5 stars and I give this game a 3 star rating. 

## Summary
Yugioh is a card battling game with two players who take turns and having a deck of 20 or more cards that the player customized. How to play is by having your deck on the right side of you and draw five cards and then flip a coin to know who will go first. Then the player will go through stages before ending their turn and there are standby, first, battle, second and end phases. 
 The player will start in an area based from the first series of YUGIOH and battle opponents to raise experience level. The more your level increases the more character players will be unlocked and will be able to find more cards to use. A new floor will be unlocked having new characters and itâ€™s called YUGIOH GX and there are others to be unlocked as well.   
## Final Thoughts
The game is about strategic planning against fellow players with rare cards that and then build different decks. Using combinations that will blow peoples mind and making sure the opponent is guessing of what your plans are. I prefer warrior monsters because they look better then other cards and there are so many combinations of decks to build, that it's hard to choose which is best. Also, it's great to have the option to choose any of the favorable characters from the television series and battle as the character.
