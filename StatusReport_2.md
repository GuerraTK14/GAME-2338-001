# Project Schedule

*We will discuss how the game is balanced between three different consoles and find out if the fun factor can be said for all. Will test how the game controls react and discuss why the systems have different designs of choice for the player to use. Once we have played the same amount of story missions and side quests will compare notes of why we chose the control functions. Next will discuss some issues about the control commands and compare notes if either of us had trouble with sensitive buttons

# Current Schedule

*I Matthew will test all functions of my controller on Playstation 4 while my teammates Justus and Angel will do the same on their conceals. Will discuss our findings on the functions and talk about why these control commands are okay for the game. Justus will talk about PC commands and find out why it works for him and the same goes for Angel on Xbox One. Once we have all the data we will see if each console is making the game enjoyable for all different consoles.

# General Notes/Overall Status
*At first it was interesting to know that the game can still be fun with different styles of control commands on different consoles. That this is awesome in a lot of ways and canâ€™t wait for the second Dying light to be released and see if they kept the same commands or changed them. Aslo, we had fun to know that we prefer different styles of commands and why there are many for players to choose their own way of playing.
