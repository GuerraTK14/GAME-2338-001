### Rating

Insert your own rating.
I  rate games from 1 to 5 stars and I will rate this game a 3 star because it seems nice to shoot as zombies as possible but I think it could be too challenging and the weapons seem simple to handle a crowd of zombies. 

## Summary

In a apology world where a crowd of zombies starts to over take space and kill anything they see. That you must survive and not get close encounters with regular zombies, small pal and large red toxic blasting creatures. The player will be sent to regular fields and some fields that are too dark to see whatâ€™s ahead. Also as for the weapons we have pistol, auto machine gun, shotguns and flame thrower.

## Final Thoughts


A game where you are able to kill zombies with guns sounds fantastic because with zombies it's all about survival. To always be in danger at every turn and fight to what random zombies that will pop up. The weapons seem fun to use because of the nature one would might use.
